# Intelligent-Decision-Making-Model-for-Loan-Application

Giving a score to a customer and subsequently deciding to approve or reject their loan application can be very taxing. There are many parameters to be considered. This project is aimed to support the bank to firstly provide exploratory analysis about its data and then develop a machine learning algorithm that can speed up loan application decision-making phase.

As result, Random Forest classifier is the model with better accuracy.
